      <h2 className="text-xlnpm run dev">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Refund Policy outlines the procedures and conditions under which
        refunds are processed on the Nile Global Marketplace (NGMP).
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Refund eligibility is primarily determined by the seller’s policy, which
        can vary from no returns accepted to 15, 30, or 60 days return options.
        <br />
        In cases where an item is not as described, NGMP mandates the seller to
        accept the return, regardless of their stated policy.
        <br />
        NGMP acts as an intermediary, ensuring fair practices and protecting
        against misuse of the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Process</h2>
      <p>
        Customers can initiate a refund by selecting the return option for their
        order, filling out the required details such as the reason for the
        return, and submitting the request.
      </p>

      <h2>Time Frame for Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        The time frame for requesting a refund depends on the seller’s return
        policy, which should be clearly stated in their store.
      </p>

      <h2>Restocking Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Restocking fees may apply depending on the seller’s policy. Sellers are
        responsible for specifying if such fees are charged.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Method</h2>
      <p>
        All refunds on NGMP are issued in Nile Money, regardless of the
        transaction's nature or the seller's individual policy. This is a
        universal policy across the platform, without exceptions.
      </p>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        In case of disputes over refunds, buyers can reach out to NGMP through
        the contact us page.
        <br />
        NGMP will mediate between the buyer and the seller to resolve the issue.
        <br />- In certain instances, NGMP may offer a Nile Guarantee, issuing a
        refund to the buyer from the platform's end.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        NGMP reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy. Changes will be
        communicated to users and will take effect immediately.
