        <p className="text-lg">
          Nile Global Marketplace serves as an intermediary platform connecting
          buyers and sellers. We facilitate transactions but are not a party to
          the contract of sale executed between buyers and sellers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-1">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold">2. User conduct:</h2>

          Users are expected to engage in transactions responsibly and in good
          faith.
          <br />
          The platform prohibits the listing and exchange of illegal items,
          counterfeit goods, and services that violate intellectual property
          rights or local laws.

          3. Initial dispute reolution:

        <p className="text-lg">
          In the event of a dispute (e.g., item not received, item not as
          described), buyers and sellers are initially encouraged to communicate
          directly to seek a resolution.
          <br />
          The platform provides tools to assist in this communication and
          resolution process.

          If the dispute cannot be resolved directly between the parties, users
          can escalate the issue to Nile Global Marketplace.
          <br />
          Our team will review the case, requiring both parties to submit
          evidence, such as transaction records, communication logs, and any
          other relevant documentation.
