    <p class="mb-4">It’s not uncommon for NO tracking information to show until your package has been scanned in by the respected carriers. It might remain “blank” for up to a week after you receive your tracking link. But If your order was placed more than a week and there is still no information on your tracking number, please contact us.</p>
    <p class="mb-4"><strong>WILL MY ITEMS BE SENT IN ONE PACKAGE?</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-4">For logistical reasons, items in the same purchase will sometimes be sent in separate packages, even if you’ve specified combined shipping.  Please keep this in mind when receiving deliveries.</p>
